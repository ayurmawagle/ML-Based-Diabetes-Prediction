# ML-Based-Diabetes-Prediction

### This project explores the application of machine learning techniques to predict diabetes using the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2023 dataset. This study is unique as it utilizes the most recent BRFSS data, which has not been previously explored in similar researchâ€”prior studies used datasets up to 2021.

## Features

- Dataset: BRFSS 2023, providing an extensive collection of health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services.
- Models: Implementation and evaluation of multiple machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines.
- Objective: To analyze and identify key predictors of diabetes while optimizing model accuracy and interpretability.
- Significance: The results aim to contribute to early detection strategies, allowing for more effective interventions and healthcare planning.
